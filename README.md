<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is our final school project made in Unity. 
It's a top-down combat and history based game, with a unique experience for each player, since the map is randomly created each gameplay and the history is also shown to each player randomly at different stages of the game. 

Main Objectives:
* Fun, challenging and responsible combat, with several enemies, each with different habilities and behaviors.
* Complex story line for the player to explore along the gameplay.
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:
